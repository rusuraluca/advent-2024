# **Advent Coding Calendar 2024**

During December 2024, I created a new project every day, emphasizing different programming languages and frameworks.

## **Overview**

**Goal:** Build fun, practical apps using various languages and frameworks.

**Duration:** 1 project per day throughout December 2024.

**Focus:** Each app highlights the strengths of a specific language or framework.

**Time Commitment:** Each project is designed to be completed in under 2 hours.

## **Daily Breakdown**

**Day 1 (Python+Flask)**: *80/20 Rule Daily Metrics Calendar*
   - A web application for tracking daily metrics in a visually appealing calendar format. This app allows users to input daily metrics (20% or 80% by the 80/20 life guiding rule) and displays them on a calendar with color-coded feedback.

**Day 2 (JavaScript)**: *Color Palette Generator*  
   - A web app that generates harmonious color schemes using JavaScript's Canvas API.
