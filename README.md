# **Advent Coding Calendar 2024**

During December 2024, I created a new project every day, emphasizing different programming languages and frameworks.

## **Overview**

**Goal:** Build fun, practical apps using various languages and frameworks.

**Duration:** 1 project per day throughout December 2024.

**Focus:** Each app highlights the strengths of a specific language or framework.

**Time Commitment:** Each project is designed to be completed in under 2 hours.

## **Daily Breakdown**

**Day 1 (Python+Flask)**: [*80/20 Rule Daily Metrics Calendar*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day1)

- A web application for tracking daily metrics in a visually appealing calendar format. This app allows users to input daily metrics (20% or 80% by the 80/20 life guiding rule) and displays them on a calendar with color-coded feedback.

**Day 2 (JavaScript)**: [*Color Palette Generator*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day2)

- A web app that generates harmonious color schemes using JavaScript's Canvas API.

**Day 3 (Ruby)**: [*Static Website Generator*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day3)

- A lightweight Ruby-based static website generator that converts Markdown files into a clean, visually appealing blog. This generator uses ERB templates for rendering HTML.

**Day 4 (C#)**: [*Currency Converter*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day4)

- A simple and efficient console-based currency converter built with C#. It demonstrates the power of LINQ and `HttpClient` to fetch and process real-time exchange rates from an external API.

**Day 5 (GO)**: [*Mini HTTP File Server*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day5)

- A lightweight Go-based HTTP server for sharing local files, demonstrating the simplicity and efficiency of Go's networking capabilities. This file server enables you to share files from a directory on your machine through a web browser.

**Day 6 (Rust)**: [*Image Resizer*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day6)

- A high-performance Rust application for resizing images in bulk, demonstrating Rust's speed and efficiency.

**Day 7 Java**: [*To-Do List*](https://github.com/rusuraluca/advent-2024/tree/main/day7)

- To-do list console app with task management (add, view, delete).
